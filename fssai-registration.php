                <h3>Overview about Food License Online </h3>
                <p>A food license is a legal document that certifies that a food business operator complies with the food safety standards and regulations set by the government. A food license is mandatory for any business that involves the handling, processing, manufacturing, packaging, storing, distributing, or selling of food or food products. A food license ensures that the food is safe for human consumption and prevents food adulteration, contamination, and fraud.   </p>
                <p>There are different types of food licenses depending on the nature, scale, and turnover of the food business. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) is the apex body that issues Food License Online in India. The FSSAI has three categories of food licenses: basic registration, state license, and central license. </p>
                <p>To obtain a food license, a food business operator must apply for <strong>FSSAI registration online </strong>or offline through the FSSAI website or the designated authorities in their respective states. The application must be accompanied by the required documents, such as identity proof, address proof, business details, layout plan, a list of products, etc. The application fee varies depending on the type and duration of the license. The FSSAI, or state authorities, will verify the application and inspect the premises of the food business before granting or rejecting the license. The license is valid for a period of one to five years and must be renewed before its expiration.</p>
