                  Overview
                </h3>
                <p>
                  If you are an unregistered brand there must be chances that your products may be
                  duplicated and sold by more than one trademark or logo. To protect yourself from
                  such duplication it is very important that you must register your design. In the case
                  of multiple trademarks, it becomes very difficult for shoppers to recognise your
                  products and keep track of whose goods they’re buying. Therefore, registering your
                  brand helps protect it against confusion and also prevents other brands from filing
                  confusing trademark infringement lawsuits against you. It also authorises you to
                  take legal action against someone who tries to steal your design for their profit.
                </p>

                <br>
                <p>
                  Industrial Designs are registered and protected through the process of design
                  Registration in India. The entire procedure of the Design Registration is governed
                  under the Designs Act-2000 and the corresponding Designs Rules-2001.
                  <b>‘DESIGN’</b> basically refers to the unique aspects of shape, figure, blueprints or
                  decorations or composition of lines thereof given to an article, which may be 2
                  dimensional or 3 dimensional or in both formats, by any manufacturing procedure
                  or mode.
                </p>

                <h3>
                  What Do You Mean by Design Registration?
                </h3>
                <p>
                  The entire procedure of the Design Registration is governed under the Designs
                  Act-2000 and the corresponding Designs Rules-2001. Any corresponding Design
                  Rules, 2001 that came into power on 11th May 2001 abolishing the earlier act of
                  1911. The Design Rules, 2001was amended by Designs (Amendement) Rules 2008
                  and Designs (Amendement) Rules 2014. The last act in Designs Rules came on
                  30th December 2014, which overpowered all the previous Design rules. It includes
                  a new category of the applicant as a small entity in addition to a natural person and
                  other than a small entity. <br><br>
                  Industrial design basically focus on the creation of innovative and original features
                  of new shape, form, surface pattern, embellishment and style or lines or colours
                  used in articles which in the finished state appeal to and which are assessed
                  individually <br><br>
                  The process involved in creation of the design may be manual, mechanical, automated
                  or chemical. Separate or all-inclusive, by which the finished article appeal to and can
                  be identified solely by the eye. However, this does not contain any
                  mode/standard/chemical/separate or all-inclusive by which the finished article appeal
                  to and can be identified solely by the eye. It also does not contain any
                  mode/standard/construction or anything which is in material a mere mechanical
                  device. Besides, it does not include any registered trademark, as defined in Section
                  2(v) of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958, as well as a property mark or an
                  artistic work as defined under the Section 2(c) of the Copyright Act, 1957.
                  The Purpose of obtaining the design registration under the Designs Act is to safeguard
                  a novel or an innovative design so created which is to be applied to a specific article
                  under manufacturing process through an Industrial Process or mode. At times, we see
                  that the buying behaviour of the customers towards some articles for consumption is
                  inclined not only by their actual product quality but also by the design of their
                  appearance, e.g., a mobile phone or goggles. The main objective of obtaining a design
                  Registration is to make sure that the particular artisan, creator, craftsman, engineer or
                  the designer of that design having unique appearance is not deprived and deceived of
                  his bonafide reward by some copycats, who might tend to use his design for their
                  goods.

                  While the former Design Rules did not differentiate between different kinds of
                  applicants, the Design (Amendment) Rules 2014, revealed two main kinds of
                  applicants i.e. ‘Natural person’ and ‘other than natural person’. The kind of ‘other than
                  a natural person’ is extra divided into ‘small entity’ and ‘others except small entity’. It
                  was also stated that any of the three categories would have different fees. Thus, the
                  categories of design applicants with varying fees now add: <b>‘natural person’, ‘small

                <p>
                  Any proprietor (design owner) who is seeking registration of a design that is original
                  and has not been published previously in any country and the one which does not seem
                  to be clashing to any law and order of the country, can file an application for getting
                  the design registered. As per section 2(j), the term ‘proprietor’ has been defined as the
                  person who:

                <h3>What is Locarno Classification Under the Design Act, 2000 ?</h3>
                <p>
                  As per the Locarno Agreement, 2000 designs are registered in different classes. The
                  agreement classifies goods for the purposes of the registration of industrial designs,
                  which further helps in design searches. These classes are mainly function-oriented.
                  Earlier, as per Designs Act, 1911, the classification of design was made on the basis of
                  the material of which the article was made, whereas the new act classifies on the basis
                  of the subject matter of the design i.e., the functionality. The new act has adopted an
                  international classification system, the Locarno Classification System, which is
                  established by the Locarno Agreement. While India is not a signatory to the Locarno
                  Agreement, its classification of industrial design is a template of the Locarno
                  Classification System.

                  What is the Procedure of Design Registration in India?
                </h3>

                <p>
                  Procedure of Design Registration in India is dealt by Chapter 2 of the
                  Design Act. Following steps should be followed to get your design
                  registered:
                </p>




                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>The first and the initial step is to file an application for registration in the
                      patent office in the prescribed form along with the prescribed fee. It is
                      very important to file complete and correct information so that application
                      is processed faster. The class in which design is to be registered must be
                      specified in the application and the “article'' to which it is to be applied.
                    </p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <p>Image/drawing related to the ‘article’ is an essential aspect of a Design
                      application. So, to avoid any sort of complication or any objections with
                      the filing image, an applicant must follow the following tips mentioned
                      below:
                    </p>
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <p>Image provided by the applicant for design registration must be
                      clear or we can say clearly seen.
                    </p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <p>Images that are present on the contrasting background must be
                      photographed.</p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <p>The image of the design should be photographed from all angles
                      i.e. front, rear, top and bottom.</p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <p>The photograph which consists of articles that is presented for
                      industrial design should be visible in all the images, and no part
                      of the article should be missing.</p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <p>Now, once the application is filed, further, it is examined by the
                      Controller of Design. A detailed evaluation of the application is
                      conducted by the Design Office. In this formal evaluation, the formal
                      compliances like whether applicant’s identification and particulars are
                      correct or not, whether articles fall in the claimed class or not, are
                      checked.
                    </p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <p>If any objection is found, the applicant will be asked to make
                      necessary amendments to get the design registered and nullify
                      objections. The applicant gets an opportunity to file a written response
                      to raised objections. If the Controller finds the written response
                      satisfactory, the application is accepted. If the Controller has an
                      objection, generally, an opportunity of hearing is given now if the
                      Controller is not convinced that the design gets rejected at the hearing.
                    </p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <p>Once the design is accepted, it is then published in the Official
                      Gazette.</p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <p>The validity of registered design is ten years from the date of
                      application, which can be renewed for another term of 5 years.</p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <p>India is one of the endorsers to the Paris Convention, which lays down
                      basic international principles primarily governing the protection of
                      patents, trademarks, and industrial designs.</p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <p>In the case of design infringement, the owner of the design can claim
                      damages and can also apply for an injunction so that design cannot be
                      used further.

                              <ul>
                                <li>
                                  <p>The first and the initial step is to file an application for registration in the
                                    patent office in the prescribed form along with the prescribed fee. It is
                                    very important to file complete and correct information so that application
                                    is processed faster. The class in which design is to be registered must be
                                    specified in the application and the “article'' to which it is to be applied.
                                  </p>
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                  <p>Image/drawing related to the ‘article’ is an essential aspect of a Design
                                    application. So, to avoid any sort of complication or any objections with
                                    the filing image, an applicant must follow the following tips mentioned
