                  FSSAI State License

                </h3>
                <p>
                  For doing any food business it is mandatory to have food license. It not only involves preparation
                  of food but everyone who handles food at various stage before it ultimately reaches the consumers
                  like raw materials, manufacturing, processing, packaging and their distribution as well as the
                  agencies who have taken the authority to sell them. This license basically ensures that food
                  business runs with appropriate quality check and license. FSSAI rules and guidelines must be
                  followed by business who requires this food license. FSSAI is responsible for the principles,
                  standards and controls for the welfare of the business.
                </p>

                <h3>
                  Overview: FSSAI
                </h3>
                <p>
                  FSSAI stands for Food Safety Standard Authority of India. It has been established under the Food
                  Safety and Standards Act, 2006 (FSS Act). FSSAI is an autonomous body which has been
                  established under the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of India which governs
                  all the food business in India. If someone wants to start their business in food industry i.e. food
                  processing, food manufacturing, distribution and packaging, it has to be registered under the Food
                  Safety Standard Authority of India (FSSAI). The food products which are packaged must have a
                  14-digit food license registration number which has to be printed on the food packages. The license
                  gives the information related to producer’s enrollment or permit subtle elements and the state
                  assembling. <br><br>
                  Things which are important to be noted that FSSAI basic registration is different from FSSAI
                  License. Depending upon the size and nature of business there are various criteria for getting the
                  license/registration which again depends upon the size and nature of the business; FBOs or we can
                  say Food Business Organization should definitely obtain the necessary license or registration.

                </p>

                <p>
                  If any Food Business is having an annual turnover more than 12 lakhs and less than 20 crores then
                  they have to obtain State FSSAI License.<br><br>
                  The capacity up to 2 MT per day of any Manufacturing Units, Dairy Units who are handling
                  business up to 50000 Liters per day, hotels who are 3 stars and above, relabeling and repackers
                  units, club canteens, all the catering business irrespective of their turnover needs to apply for the
                  State Food License. The minimum tenure of Food License is one year and the maximum tenure of
                  the Food License is five years.<br><br>
                  It must be noted that Form B is required to file for the State Food License when the turnover is
                  less than 20 crores and the area of operation is limited to state only.
