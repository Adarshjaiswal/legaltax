                              The most preferred business structures for a startup are Private Limited companies and LLPs. A Private Limited company is legally recognized and generally favored by investors. However, it has stricter compliance and may have a higher cost of incorporation.
                              Whereas incorporation cost is lower for LLPs and they tend to have relaxed compliance in comparison to the Private Limited Companies. In addition to that, LLPs have limited liabilities and are equally recognized by investors and all over the world.
