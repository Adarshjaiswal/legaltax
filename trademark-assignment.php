                  Overview
                </h3>
                <p>
                  A trademark is simply the name of your business. Trademark is involved in the name of the business itself, a logo or a “combined mark” that covers both your business name and the logo related to that. Like any other property or asset, the owner of the trademark (the assignor) has the right to sell, license or transfer the same. The transfer of trademark is possible thorugh the Trademark Assignment Agreement or Trademark Licensing. The current article basically explains the term trademark assignment along with its advantage, types of trademark assignment, pre-requisites and procedure of trademark assignment.

                  Trademark Assignment
                </h3>

                <p>
                  Trademark is an intellectual property and like any other asset, the proprietor of a trademarks has the authority or power to sell, license or transfer the owned intellectual property. Such transfer can be made through Trademark Assignment or through licensing. <br><br>
                  Whenever a trademark is assigned, there is some sort of variation in the ownership of the registered brand. But when it is licensed, the benefits related to the trademark continue to vest with the buyer but only a few qualified rights are given to the third party. This assignment can be done with or without assigning the goodwill of business. In case of a registered trademark, such as assignment is required to be recorded in the Register of a trademark. <br><br>
                  Some of the advantages of the trademark assignment (concerning both the owner and the buyer) are listed hereunder-

                </p>



                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                       The trademark assignment enables the owner of the trademark to en cash the value of his brand.
                    </p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <p>
                       With the help of a trademark assignment, the assignee can obtain the rights of an already established brand.
                    </p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <p>
                       The assignment of the trademark supports both the assignor and the assignee to expand their respective business.
                    </p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <p>
                       In case of any dispute, the trademark assignment agreement would enable the assignor or the assignee to establish the legal right.

                  Trademark Licensing
                </h3>

                <p>
                  The licensing of a mark is to allow others to use the mark without assigning the ownership and the same may be done for all or some of the goods and services covered. The Trademarks Act does not mention the term 'License', the concept under the Act is mentioned as that of a 'Registered User'. <br><br>
                  Trademark licensing is advantageous to both the parties. While the licensor enjoys its rights to the mark by getting the royalties for its use, the licensee is able to expand its market operations by using the brand and developing its reputation. <br><br>
                  In case of Licensing, the licensor is open to license the rights over the trademark in manner it may like. The Licensor can restrict the rights of the licensee in a trademark or brand with respect to the products or services wherein the licensee can use such brand, with respect to time for which it can use such mark, with respect to area within which it can use such mark etc.

                  <b>
                    All the four types of trademark assignments are briefly explained here as follows-
                  </b>
                </p>


                <p>
                  <b>
                    1. Partial assignment:
                  </b>
                  Under the partial assignment, the assignor transfers only limited ownership with regard to specific products/ services.
                </p>


                <p>
                  <b>
                    2. Complete assignment:
                  </b>

                  Under the complete assignment, entire rights with respect to the registered trademark are transferred by the assignor to the assignee.
                </p>


                <p>
                  <b>
                    3. An assignment with Goodwill:
                  </b>
                  Where an assignor assigns to the assignee, the value, rights and entitlements also, as associated with a trademark with respect to the goods or services already in use by the assignor. After taking over the goodwill associated with the trademark, the assignee is free to use the trademark assigned to him for all goods or services including for the goods or services which were already in use by the Assignor. Such assignment is called assignment with Goodwill of Business.

                  <br>
                  <b>For Example: </b>
                  Mr. A is the owner of a trademark “TM” who is already using the said trademark “TM” in relation to clothing and footwear. Mr. A assign to Mr. B the said trademark “TM” through an agreement (in writing) in relation to clothing and footwear along with the Goodwill associated with trademark “TM”. <br><br>
                  In this case, Mr. A has also assigned to Mr. B, the Goodwill associated with trademark “TM” for the business of clothing and footwear as well as for other goods or services. Therefore, Mr. B is eligible to use the said trademark “TM”, for clothing and footwear including other goods or service dealt by Mr. B.

                </p>

                <p>
                  <b>4. Gross assignment or Assignment without Goodwill: </b>
                  assignment, while transferring the trademark, the assignor will restrict the buyer’s right. The assignor here restricts the buyer from using a brand of the product which is already being used by the assignor. In nut-shell, the goodwill attached to the brand is not transferred to the assignee. <br><br>
                  Where an assignor assigns to the assignee, the right and entitlements in a trademark with respect to the goods or services which are not in use by the assignor. In other words, where the assignor restricts the assignee with a condition that the assignee is not entitled to use the trademark assigned in relation to the goods or services already in use by the assignor. Such assignment is called assignment without the Goodwill of Business. <br><br>
                  <b>For Example:</b> Mr. A is the owner of a trademark “TM” who is already using the said trademark “TM” in relation to clothing and footwear. Mr. A assign to Mr. B the said trademark “TM” through an agreement (in writing) in relation to goods or services other than clothing and footwear without assigning the Goodwill associated with trademark “TM”.<br><br>
                  In this case, Mr. X has not assigned to Mr. B, the Goodwill associated with trademark “TM” for the business of clothing and footwear. Therefore, Mr. B is not eligible to use the said trademark “TM”, for clothing and footwear. Thus, in case, Mr. B wishes to use the said trademark “TM” in relation to other goods or services then he will be required to create separate Goodwill for trademark “TM” for such other goods or services dealt by him.

                    Right of the Assignor on Assignment of Trademark:
                  </b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The assignor terminates to have his rights, title or any interest in the trademark, the moment assignment deed is executed in favor of the assignee, irrespective of the fact that the name of the assignee has not been updated in the record of the Registrar of trademarks.
                  In the matter of Classic Equipments Pvt. Ltd. vs. Johnson Enterprises, 2009 (41) PTC 385 (Del), it was observed as follows:

                </p>

                <u>
                  <b>
                    “Once an Assignment Deed has executed, the Assignor ceases to have any right, title or interest in the property assigned. It is not open to the Assignor to cancel the assignment by means of communication”.

                <p>
                  <b>Rights of the Assignee: When Assignment Is Complete but Registration Is Pending:</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Though as per section 45 of the Act, it is mandated that the assignee shall apply before the Registrar of the trademarks to register his title. But this does not mean that recording of assignment of registered trademark asserts all rights or titles or interest in the assignee.
                  The reason behind this understanding are the opening words of section 45 of the Act, which says <i>“where a person becomes entitled by assignment or transmission of a registered trademark, ……..”.</i> Therefore, the first condition is entitlement of rights, title or interest by way of assignment or transmission of a registered trademark followed by registration of assignment of a registered trademark. Thus right in assignee does exist even before the registration of assignment.
                  In the matter of M/S. Modi Threads Limited vs M/S. Som Soot Gola Factory And…. on 4th December, 1990: AIR 1992 Delhi 4, 1992 (22) DRJ 24 was observed as follows:

                  <br>
                  <b> 
                    <u>
                      “It is true that the plaintiffs application for getting transferred the registered trade mark in its name in the office of the Registrar is still pending but that does not debar the plaintiff to protect the violation of the aforesaid trade mark at the hands of unscrupulous persons by filing an action in court of law for injunction. It is, prima facie, clear to me that during the interregnum period when the application of the plaintiff is kept pending for consideration by the Registrar of Trade Marks the dishonest persons cannot be allowed to make use of the said trade mark in order to get themselves illegally enriched earning upon the reputation built up qua that trade mark by the predecessor-in-interest of the plaintiff.”
                    </u>
                  </b>

                </p>

                <p>
                  The assignee of a trademark is also entitled to file a civil suit, even though the recording of assignment of registered trademark is pending before the registrar of trademarks. Moreover, section 45 does not confer any title over the trademark assigned. Instead the registration granted under section 45 is only proof of title of the trademark of assignee or the person who acquired it by way of assignment.

                <p>
                  Assignment and Licensing of brands are considerable issues and proper strategizing may open vistas of opportunities for all, a licensor, a licensee, an assignor and an assignee. Both concepts involve a degree of planning for the future of the parties involved and the brand in question. The development of a brand, its propagation and its use, all lie in the hands of the proprietor of the brand and trademark and assignment and licensing are effective methods to manage the same. Assignment of trademarks allows the Proprietor thereof to en-cash their intellect, efforts, time and money. It is equally important to register the assignment of trademark, since on registration the details of the assignee are updated in the register of trademark, this serves as a notice to public at large. Moreover, preparation of assignment agreements is also important as it involves rights, entitlements, interests and obligation including the commercial terms between the assignor and the assignee.

The transfer of trademark is possible thorugh the Trademark Assignment Agreement or Trademark Licensing. The current article basically explains the term trademark assignment along with its advantage, types of trademark assignment, pre-requisites and procedure of trademark assignment.

                                Trademark is an intellectual property and like any other asset, the proprietor of a trademarks has the authority or power to sell, license or transfer the owned intellectual property. Such transfer can be made through Trademark Assignment or through licensing. <br><br>
                                Whenever a trademark is assigned, there is some sort of variation in the ownership of the registered brand. But when it is licensed, the benefits related to the trademark continue to vest with the buyer but only a few qualified rights are given to the third party. This assignment can be done with or without assigning the goodwill of business. In case of a registered trademark, such as assignment is required to be recorded in the Register of a trademark. <br><br>
                                Some of the advantages of the trademark assignment (concerning both the owner and the buyer) are listed hereunder-
