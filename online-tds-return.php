                  What Is TDS?
                </h3>

                <p>
                  <b>TDS:</b> Tax deducted at source or TDS is the tax that is collected by the Government of India at the time when a transaction takes place. Here, in this case, the tax is to be deducted at the time the money is credited to the payee's account or at the time of payment whichever happens earlier. <br><br>
                  In this case of salary payment or the life insurance policy, the tax is deducted at the time when the payment is done. The deductor is required to deposit this amount with the Income Tax Department. Through TDS a portion of the tax is paid directly to the Income Tax Department. The Tax is deducted usually over a range of 10%.

                              <b>TDS:</b> Tax deducted at source or TDS is the tax that is collected by the Government of India at the time when a transaction takes place. Here, in this case, the tax is to be deducted at the time the money is credited to the payee's account or at the time of payment whichever happens earlier. <br><br>
                              In this case of salary payment or the life insurance policy, the tax is deducted at the time when the payment is done. The deductor is required to deposit this amount with the Income Tax Department. Through TDS a portion of the tax is paid directly to the Income Tax Department. The Tax is deducted usually over a range of 10%.
