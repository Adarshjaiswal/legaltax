                                <p>
                                    Our focus is complete customer satisfaction. In the event, if you are displeased with the services
                                    provided, we will refund back the money, provided the reasons are genuine and proved after
                                    investigation. Please read the fine prints of each deal before taking the services.

                                </p>

                                <p class="sbhding">Cancellation Policy</p>

                                <p>
                                    If the customer changes its mind for the services taken, we will not be liable to cancel the service. In
                                    case customers asks us to hold the processing of the service, we shall hold the fees paid for a period
                                    of 1 year from the date of payment. <br><br>
                                    Before processing any refund, we reserve the right to make best effort to complete the service. In
                                    case, of non-completion of services post receipt of refund request, a cancellation fee of 20% + earned
                                    fee + fee paid to government or any third party would be applicable.

                                </p>

                                    We will refund the money only in case we fail to provide service to our customers from our end post
                                    our internal investigation. Applicant need to apply for the same via email at info@legaltax.in
                                    Refund will not be provided to the user, once it is earned by the company, because of the time and
                                    energy invested by our manpower for their work done, which is not returnable. So basically, all the
                                    processing fees, payment gateway charges, admin fees, and cost of resources for the work done,
                                    will be deducted. In short, further, we can’t refund any money which is paid to government bodies,
                                    such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order.
