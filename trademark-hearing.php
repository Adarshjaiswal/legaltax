                                    Trademark hearing is a physical appearance before the registrar of trademarks
                                    both in person or by a trademark attorney or trademark agent for removing the
                                    objections proposed under review from a report announced after a trademark
                                    registration statement or application. The prospects for trademark objection are
                                    nowadays very important and trademark hearing occurs if the register authority
                                    is not satisfied with the response registered against the objection proposed in the
                                    final report in the method of trademark certification.

                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Trademark objections happen when there is something wrong with the way the
                                    application has been filed, with the trademark itself or some other reasons. While
                                    the reply to the examination report is enough to aid you in getting your
                                    application and your trademark accepted, there are many times that they are not
                                    helpful. Therefore, the next step is the trademark hearing. <br><br>
                                    If you’re an entrepreneur or a business head who has received a show cause notice
                                    for your trademark application, then there will be a need for you to present your
                                    case to the Trademark Examiner against the trademark objection raised by the
                                    concerned authority. This Article will help you understand the trademark hearing
                                    process in India and prepare you to take the right steps forward. Therefore, you
                                    should only look for nothing but the best trademark attorneys. Fortunately,

                                    the product. Most importantly a perfect trademark should be executed in such a manner that it
                                    can be unique from other trademarks of the same class and should be ready to be registered and
                                    protected. The following are the few qualities of a good trademark that should be considered
                                    before trademark registration:

                                            A trademark must be a mark that comprises a device, brand, label, heading, ticket,
                                            word, letter, signature, name, packaging, numeral, or combination of colours or any
                                            sequence of the above attributes.

                                            It should be simple to pronounce and spell. A good trademark is such that the public
                                            can simply speak and spell.
                                        </p>

                                            Further, it should be easy to identify and remember. A good trademark that is easy to
                                            speak and spell can be simply identified as well. So that it becomes simple for the
                                            public as well.

                                            It should not be too long and should preferably be difficult to forget easily. If it is
                                            lengthy or difficult, people will not bother to take the effort to memorise it and,
                                            ultimately, it will be forgotten.
