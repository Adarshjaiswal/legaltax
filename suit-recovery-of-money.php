                </p>
                <p>
                  Money Recovery! Is this something that you're currently concerned about? You've
                  probably lent money to people before, but things didn't work out, and they defaulted
                  on paying you back. Or do you want to recover your own money from other parties?
                  A suit for the recovery of money is an effective and efficient way to recover a debt
                  from the debtor. The civil remedy for money recovery is suing a money defaulter.
                  It's the filing of a lawsuit in a court of competent jurisdiction.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The suit may be filed under Order IV of the Code of Civil Procedure, which was
                  enacted in 1908, (CPC).
                </p>
                <p>
                  From now on, you won't have to be concerned about it. You might wonder ‘how’
                  and ‘why’. If you're considering filing a lawsuit for money recovery, it's important
                  to understand what that entails. Let us first understand what money recovery or
                  money recovery suit really means, and then we will discuss how you can recover
                  your money legally, what are the money recovery laws in India, and other important
                  details about it.
                </p>

                <p>
                  You would have faced a situation where another person or company has failed to
                  repay for services/ products already received. To recover your money, Legaltax will
                  help you file a <b>‘summary suit’</b> for recovery of money through an expert debt
                  recovery lawyer.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Before filing a suit for recovery of money, sending a legal notice to the defaulting
                  party serves as a final warning to clear the outstanding payment. In case the dispute
                  is still not resolved, you should then file the case.
                </p>

                <p>
                  To send a <b>legal notice</b> first, send a legal notice as a final communication to the
                  opposite party to resolve the issue before you file a case against them in the court of
                  law. A legal notice typically prompts receiver to take immediate action and resolve
                  the issue.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Legaltax will help you send the legal notice through an expert lawyer.
                  <b>Limitation Period </b>
                  The time period for filing a suit for money recovery is 3 years from the date when
                  the cause of action arises. However, it can also be condoned and subjected to the
                  discretion of the court.

                  Where we can file suit for recovery of money?

                </p>
                <p>
                  After understanding the meaning of a money recovery suit, the next possible
                  question in your mind could be the place where you can file a case for a suit related
                  to money recovery in India. The jurisdiction for filing a money recovery case can be
                  decided based on the place or location where your money defaulter belongs and the
                  pecuniary limit that a court can have power over it.
                </p>
                <p id="s_ltx"><b>Territorial Jurisdiction </b></p>
                <p>
                  The most important thing when you're deciding where to file a case is whether the
                  court has territorial jurisdiction over the person or not. Under this type of
                  jurisdiction, the geographical limits of a court’s authority are clearly delineated and
                  specified. It cannot exercise authority beyond that territorial/geographical limit.
                  As per CPC, 1908 a suit can be filed at any of the given territorial jurisdiction:
                  Place where the defendant (money defaulter) resides.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Place where the defendant runs his/her business or has a medium of earning.
                  Place where the cause of action arises either wholly or partially.
                  This was about territorial jurisdiction, but we need to keep in mind pecuniary
                  jurisdiction also. Like where to file the case, be it district court, high court, or
                  supreme court.
                </p>

                <p id="s_ltx">
                  Pecuniary Jurisdiction
                </p>

                <p>
                  Pecuniary means ‘related to money’. Pecuniary jurisdiction tries to address whether
                  a court of law can try cases and suits of the monetary value/amount of the case or
                  suit in question.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is determined by the pecuniary value(amount of money)you are dealing with.
                  Based on the pecuniary amount, the case for money recovery can be filed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <i>For example, the pecuniary jurisdiction of the Courts in Delhi are as follows:</i>
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <p>Suits amounting between Rs.1 – Rs.20, 00,000/- lie before District Courts.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Suits over and above Rs. 20,00,000/- lie before the High Court.</p>
                  </li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                  <b>
                    Note: First territorial jurisdiction is determined then you have to look for
                    pecuniary jurisdiction.

                              The jurisdiction can be decided based on the place or location where your money
                              defaulter belongs and the pecuniary limit that a court can have power over it. The
                              most important thing when you're deciding where to file a case is whether the court
                              has territorial jurisdiction over the person or not. Then you have to check for the
                              pecuniary jurisdiction. This is determined by the pecuniary value (amount of money)
                              you are dealing with. Based on the pecuniary amount, the case for money recovery
                              can be filed.

                              A summary suit is a legal procedure for faster and efficient remedy. In case of
                              admitted liability by the debtor or financial liability arising out of a written contract,
                              a summary suit can be filed in a Civil Court for speedier recovery of money. Unlike
                              normal cases, summary cases are disposed off quickly. The summary suit is based
                              only on written statements from both parties without any unnecessary trial hearing.
                              At the time of filing of the summary case, necessary documents such as bills,
                              invoices, contracts, delivery receipts etc. are required to be attached with the petition.

                              The procedure in a summary suit ensures that there are no unjustified delays in
                              delivering justice. It is a speedier and efficient recourse to recover your money
                              when compared to ordinary civil suits. The debtor in a summary suit does not have
                              a right to defend her/ his case if the liability is arising out of a written contract,
                              guarantee or enactment. After filing of the suit, the debtor/ defendant is required
                              to mark an appearance in Court within 10 days and has to apply for leave to defend
                              the suit. In his application, she/ he has to convince the court of circumstances
                              warranting a detailed trial. However, in most cases, it has been seen that the Court
                              does not grant such leave to the defendant and hence a judgment is delivered by
                              the Court straightaway without having detailed hearings or detailed examination
                              of evidences.
