            <p>
              Child  care is one of the most difficult parts of separation. It has a direct impact on both parents, their children and the well-being of that child. This is why it is important to understand how child custody works in India. This is because it works compared to the western countries where most divorces are settled.

                </p>
                <p>
                  Custody issues arise when parents separate.Child custody is a legal term
                  regarding guardianship which is used to describe the legal and practical
                  relationship between a parent / guardian and a child in that person's care. Child
                  custody means legal custody of a child, which makes decisions about the child,
                  and physical custody. Normally Married parents have joint legal and physical
                  custody of their children. Decisions about child custody typically arise while
                  proceedings involving divorce, annulment, separation or adoption. In most
                  jurisdictions child custody is determined according to children's interests but
                  doesn't compromise with the future of children.

                  What Is Child Custody in India?
                </p>

                <p>
                  In India, mother and father both have legal rights to the child. It means that
                  the mother has the right to raise and care for the child as well as father..Both
                  are also entitled to visitations with the child. The courts do not decide on
                  custody based on which parent is more suitable or better suited to care for the
                  child because in growing age both parents are important for the child. In this
                  case, in maximum cases , it would be a tie between both parents. This system
                  of custody depends- that society views women as the weaker gender on the
                  other side. They would rather give mothers legal rights over children because
                  they believe mothers can do best caring for children while fathers should be out
                  working and providing financially for their children.

                  How Child Custody Works in India ?

                </p>
                <p>
                  It's very difficult for Indian courts to make decisions about child custody with a
                  view to the welfare of children. Child custody is a state-based concern in India,
                  so each state itself sets rules and regulations. In India, many people prefer joint
                  custody rather than sole custody.If a parent does not have to share custody of
                  their children, it can either be shared or not. If the parents do not agree on a
                  joint or non-joint guardianship, the court will decide who will have full custody
                  of their child. In most cases, the court will ask both parents what they want if
                  they do not agree.

                    <p> <b>Types of Child Custody in India
                      </b> It means that the child will be under the guardianship
                      of that parent, and other parent only have visitation rights periodically.
                      This is the most common method of ensuring that the child receives all
                      the family benefits and love and has the best upbringing as possible. The
                      environment around the child must be enriching and fulfilling while trying
                      not to deprive the child of his parents’ affection during their growing
                      years.

                  <li>
                    <p> <b>Special Guardianship:</b> In India different types of custody is recognised
                      ,that is special guardianship. Special guardianship refers to when a
                      guardian or other person has legal custody over a child ,it doesn't matter
                      that he /she will be the biological parent or not . This type of custody is
                      only possible if both parents agree on the same. Here is an important
                      difference between legal and physical custody, which you should be
                      familiar with. Legal custody gives power, rights and responsibilities for
                      raising or caring for the child. In contrast, physical custody means where
                      the child lives either of the parents or both and how much time the child
                      spends with each parent. <br>
                      Suppose a court grants legal guardianship to a father. In that case, the
                      father will have full responsibility over all aspects of the child’s life as long
                      as he is willing to provide that amount of care and support. However, if
                      he stops providing care, their right to guardianship terminates
                      immediately.

                  <li>
                    <p> <b>Joint Custody/Partial Custody/ physical custody:</b>

                      One common type of joint custody is sharing both physical and legal
                      custody.here, the child will spend some portion of time living with each
                      parent (joint custody), and the parents will cooperatively make decisions
                      about the child's upbringing and welfare, similar to when they were
                      married (legal custody).It can also be called as physical custody
                      Example: Mother and Father arrange a schedule where Child lives with
                      each parent for one month at a time (physical custody), and they agree
                      that they will decide together on all major issues related to Child's
                      welfare and upbringing (legal custody).

                    <p> <b> Guardianship of Minor Children : </b> According to the Hindu law
                      guardianship of a minor child is the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act,
                      1956. According to Section 4(a) of the Act, a minor is a person who is
                      below the age of eighteen. Acc. to Section 4(b) of the Act, a guardian is a
                      person who is completely responsible for the care of the child and as well
                      as the child’s property or both. The section further states the different
                      types of guardians:</p>

                      custody. Keep in mind - child custody petition usually takes longer because of civil
                      nature, thus its ideal to attach an application for interim or temporary custody as well as
                      visitation right by the non-custodial parent.

                  <li>Child is being deprived of the father's love, presence, and company due to the

                  <li>
                    I can take good care of my child. Now here are several points as per your sole
                    custody or shared custody goal, like how you can take care of the child, and the
                    child is attached to you, and how you can contribute to the child's growth and
                    development. I would suggest desist from bragging about your financial earning
                    or status, since that only reduces one from father to an ATM. This is a major trap
                    which many men fall for, thinking that their earning and income will be a major
                    factor for the court to decide child custody in their favor. What will instead happen
                    is that the court will say that mother is required for the small child (most of cases
                    we see are in early stages of marriage), father is earning well, let him pay
                    maintenance to wife for both wife and child, and award you twice visitation a
                    month to show love and affection to child. So from
                    hoping-for-full-custody-dad-thereby-teaching-wife-lesson-too, one becomes a
                    visiting dad in a child's life in short order. And the much bragged about high
                    earnings of the father can only be useful now to buy expensive gifts for the kid,
                    which have more of excitement than growth value for the kid.

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Depending on the child's age and requirements, you can suggest taking
                    responsibility for the child's school fees, educational expenses, which is a very
                    good strategy otherwise too, since that gives you some or full control over which
                    school the child goes to. The reason for this is that sometimes mothers can
                    change their child's school just to keep the kid further away from father, or for
                    various reasons.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Offer to open a bank account in a minor child’s name where you can be guardian,
                    and you can suggest the respondent can be made guardian too, and that
                    account will be used only for the purpose for spending on the child. This will end
                    the possibility of maintenance given to the wife in the name of the child being
                    used for other purposes. Later, you can ask for bank statement of this account
                    and if there are lot of unexplained withdrawals from the account, which the
                    respondent mother can’t explain how were being spent on child’s welfare, then
                    you can use that point to gain better child custody or full custody in case of gross
                    misuse of the funds too. The deposits into that account can be made in
                    proportion to the incomes of the husband and wife.

                  Conclusion

                </p>
                <p>
                  Now it's 2022, courts started to consider custody disputes in view of child welfare and
                  giving more weightage to the rights of the child rather than the rights of the parent.
                  Courts observe that ,A child is the future of the nation and therefore it is very
                  important that the child should be grown in a good environment where he is
                  treated and nurtured properly. Once the divorce is granted, the court becomes solely
                  responsible for the children, and any decision made thereafter is taken keeping in mind
                  the best interest of the child.The main aspect of appointing guardians should be
                  that there should be the welfare of the child. <br>

                  If a Hindu male passes away without a Will and has no class 1 or class 2 heirs or
                  agnates, then the succession would be gone to cognates. Cognates are related
                  to the intestate by blood or adoption but not wholly, through male. Thus mother’s
                  brother’s son and brother’s daughter's son are cognates, eligible for heirship.
