For certain businesses getting s GST registration is mandatory. According to the GST Act, penalties are applicable if a business is operating without ba GST registration.

Subsequently, the compliances depend upon licenses or registrations taken by a specific sole proprietorship.

Therefore, there is no such obligation of uploading the Annual report or other reports on the website of Ministry of Corporate affairs.
