                  for good luck, or for a new identity. The process of changing one's name is very time-consuming
                  because of lots of administrative formalities.

                <p>
                  Gazette publication is the final step of the name change process. Once the Gazette
                  notification is published, your name will be legally changed. Once the application is
                  received by the officials, the documents will be checked and sent for notification to the
                  respective Govt. of India Press. It usually takes around 15 to 50 days for name change
                  advertisements to appear in the Gazette Publication. Applicants can download the
                  e-copy from the Digital Directory of the Gazette of India. Also, a copy of the name
                  change notification in the Gazette of India will be sent to your residential address by
                  post.
