                  One Person Company Registration
                </h3>
                <p>
                  <b>An Overview</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  A One Person Company is a company that has only one person as a member. One Person Company (OPC) was came into effect to encourage individuals who are a potential holders for starting their own business. OPC enables a sole proprietor to convert his firm into a Limited Liability company and also avails the benefit related to the Company. <br><br>
                  OPC is a kind of a business structure that enjoys the benefits of both form of business i.e. a sole proprietorship and a company. It also eliminates the complications related to finding the right kind of co-partners for starting a business as registered entity.
                  <br><br>

                  As Per Section 2(62) of the Companies Act, 2013, One Person Company means a company that has only one person as a member. One Person Company is bringing the unstructured Proprietorship Business into the structured version of a private company. OPC is opening the path for sole proprietors and start-ups.
                  <br><br>
                  One Person Company feature is such that is has only one share holder who owns 100% stake of the company. To understand one person company definition, we first need to get into the identity it creates. A registration not only provides corporate status but it also provides many benefits to the members and the directors. In case of Private Company, at least two members are required which is not the same in the case of OPC. To eliminate this drawback and allow a single person to get the advantages of One Person Company, this sort of a company structure is introduced through the Companies Act, 2013. One Person Company registration is simplified with online filing and process. <br><br>
                  The structure of the one person company (OPC) in recent times was launched as a refinement of the structure of a sole proprietorship firm. In an OPC, a single promoter gains full authority over the company thereby, restricting his/her liability towards their contributions to the enterprise. Therefore, the said person will be the sole shareholder and director (however, a director nominee is present, but has zero power until the real director proves incapable of carrying on). Also, there can be no opportunity for contributing to employee stock options or equity funding. Additionally, if an OPC has an average turnover of ₹2 crores thrice in a row and over or acquires a paid-up fund of ₹50 lakh and over, it has to be converted to a private limited company or public limited company within six months.

                    <p>
                      <b> Step 1: Apply for DSC and DIN : </b>
                      The first step of the OPC registration is to get DSC or Digital Signature Certificate of the Directors. For this some documents are needed these are as followes:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>
                        <b> Aadhar card of the proposed director</b>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <b> Address proof of the proposed director</b>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <b>Email id and Phone number of the proposed director</b>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <b> Latest photo of the director</b>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <b>PAN card of the director</b>
                      </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                      Once the DSC is made, now the next step will be to get the Director Identification Number (DIN) of the proposed director in SPICe Form <b>(Simplified Performa for Incorporating a Company Electronically)</b> along with the address and identity proof of the Company’s director.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                      Form DIR-3 is the option only available for present companies. The candidate does not need to file the Form DIR-3 separately. Now the Director Indentification Number can be applied within SPICe Form for up to 3 directors
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      <b>
                        Step 2: Application for Name Approval:
                      </b>
                      After obtaining <b>DSC</b> and <b>DIN</b>, the next step is to decide the company's name. The company's name will be in the form of <b> XYX (OPC) </b> Private Limited. The name can be approved in the <b>SPICe and 32 Form.</b> Only one preferred name and the importance of keeping that name can be given in the <b>SPICe and 24 Application Form.</b> In case the name of the company is not accepted or get rejected, another name can be submitted by applying another SPICe and 32 Form. Once the suggested name is approved by the <b><a href="https://www.mca.gov.in/MinistryV2/applyfordin.html" style="color: blue;"> Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA)</a> </b>, you can move to the next step.
