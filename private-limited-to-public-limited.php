                                    Overview
                                </h3>

                                <p>
                                    As per the Private limited companies are concerned, they offer so much by itself,
                                    but at
                                    some point every private limited company wishes to turn public so that they can
                                    enlarge
                                    their scalability. So, the question that we come across is, “why to choose public?”
                                    The
                                    answer to this question depends on certain differences that occur between private
                                    limited companies and public limited companies which also offer the concept of
                                    Initial
                                    Public Offering (IPO) and also has the concept of shares to the general public.

                                </p>
                                <p>The restriction on transferability of shares is removed by Initial Public Offering,
                                    which is
                                    the characteristic of private limited companies. In any public limited company it
                                    has
                                    been settled that there is no cap in terms to the maximum number of members, thereby
                                    it permits them to gain and raise easy access to funding. Consequently, flexibility
                                    and
                                    growth are the preferable reasons for the changing from private to public.

                                A Private company can be converted in to public company by complying with the
                                following requirements, which are mentioned below:

                                    <li>As per Section 14 by passing a special resolution, alteration of its articles
                                        by AOA, thereby deleting the three restrictions of a Pvt. Company.

                                    <li>As per Section 13 by passing special resolution, altering its name thereby
                                        removing the word ‘Private’ from its name.</li>
                                    <li>If there are only 2 directors then the number of directors should be
                                        increased to at least 3, for these steps should be taken to increase the
                                        number of members to at least 7 if the number of members is below 7.</li>
                                    <li>Under Section 14 from the date of passing Special resolution the company
                                        turned out to be public. However, the change in its name, by deleting the

                                    <li>Transfer of shares efficiently: Public limited company shareholders can
                                        transfer their own shares with great efficiency and ease. Filing of share
                                        transfer form is needed, and after the hand over the share certificate to the
                                        buyer. The procedure of transfer of shares to a new business structure is
                                        very risky.

                                    <li>Raise in Capital: One can leverage to raise the capital from the general

                                        which has it all. This however, requires listing on a stock
                                        exchange. All public limited companies can issue fixed deposits,
                                        debentures, and convertible debentures to the general public.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Greater Reliability: Public limited companies have to inform about any
                                        structural change to the regulatory bodies, the audited statement of their
                                        account must be disclosed, and for all the shareholders have to hold
                                        annual general body meetings. To the entity these compliance procedures
                                        bring an immense deal of credibility. Public companies catch the attention
                                        of more brand identity</li>
                                    <li> Free Transfer of Shares: There is free transfer of shares of Public
