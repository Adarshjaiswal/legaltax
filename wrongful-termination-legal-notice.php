                  Overview
                </p>
                <p>
                  Illegal termination is one of the most commonly occurring employment disputes in India. Each
                  year, many employees face wrongful termination and are left stranded with no financial support.
                  If you are an employee who has been wrongfully terminated, you have the legal remedy to send a
                  legal notice to your employer. <br><br>
                  The legal recourse starts by sending a legal notice to the company for the illegal termination and
                  to recover any dues as per the terms of your employment with the company. In case of no reply to
                  the legal notice, one may choose to file a suit for recovery of legitimate dues like unpaid salary,
                  salary in lieu of notice period not allowed to serve, PF, gratuity and so on.
                  Send a legal notice as a final communication to your employer to resolve the issue before you file
                  a case against them in a court of law. A legal notice typically prompts the receiver to take
                  immediate action and resolve the issue.

                  WRONGFUL TERMINATION?
                </p>

                <p>
                  By initiating the correct and appropriate legal proceedings, an employee who has been
                  wronged can secure his/her job term and can also recover his/her due salary. The main
                  relief an employee can get from the legal remedies is monetary compensation or damages.
                  The purpose of monetary damages is to compensate you for what you lost because of the
                  employer's actions. You will have to prove not only that you suffered losses because of the
                  employer's wrongful actions, but also the amount of those losses.

                  WHY IS LEGAL NOTICE FOR WRONGFUL TERMINATION REQUIRED?
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are legal remedies that an employee can take recourse to, in case he/she has been
                  illegally/unlawfully terminated. It is important to choose the correct legal remedy against your
                  company/employer in order to get justice (and your salary). Given below are simple yet crucial
                  steps that will help you if you have been terminated illegally. <br><br>
                  The first step should be to send a legal notice since most cases get resolved in this step itself and
                  you do not need to proceed to Court. One must send a well-drafted and legally sound notice to
                  ensure that you get a prompt response on your notice and you have maximum opportunity to
                  redress your claim.

                  WHAT SHOULD A LEGAL NOTICE FOR WRONGFUL TERMINATION COVER?


                </p>

                <p>
                  Legal notice is the first step of the legal recourse/court case. A legal notice must consist of the
                  entire story in descriptive terms, signed by a lawyer. Through a legal notice, you must seek end to
                  end damages including back pay, lost benefits, injunctive relief, punitive damages, health
                  insurance provident fund and loss of salary. A specific time period for reply and for the
                  company/employer to compensate you for your loss of job and your salary (including payment of
                  interest for the delay) should be mentioned. It should also be stated that you would file a case in a
                  court if your legal notice is not complied with within the specified time period.

                              A legal notice is usually sent by an advocate on his/her client behalf. Although it is not mandatory
                              for a person to send a legal notice through an advocate, it is advised that it is sent after taking legal
                              assistance and through a lawyer. Once a legal notice is sent, you cannot make any amendments to
                              it and you cannot contradict the statements and information that you have already mentioned in
                              the legal notice. It is very important that your legal notice is drafted elaborately in legal language
                              covering all things that you demand from the opponent. Therefore, it becomes necessary to engage
                              a qualified Advocate to draft the legal notice.

                              Generally, sending a legal notice settles many disputes. In most cases, it is found that a legal notice
                              has prompted the partner/ spouse to take immediate action within the time limit provided, without
                              the necessity to take the matter to the court. Legal notices have played a very important role here.
                              It all depends on how the notice is drafted – the focus is on resolving the issue at hand and not to
                              create tension.
