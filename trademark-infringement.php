                  TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT IN INDIA 
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Trademark infringement is a violation of the exclusive rights attaching to a registered trademark without the authorization of the trademark owner or any licenses (provided that such authorization was within the scope of the license). Infringement may occur when the infringer (i.e. the person doing the infringing act), uses a trademark which is identical or confusingly similar to a registered trademark owned by another person, in relation to products or services which are identical or similar to the products or services which the registration covers. The owner of such registered trademark may commence legal proceedings against the infringer.
                  <br><br>
                  A trademark which is not registered cannot be infringed as such, and the trademark owner cannot bring infringement proceedings. Instead, the owner can commence proceedings under the common law for passing off or misrepresentation, or under legislation which prohibits unfair business practices. In some jurisdictions, infringement of trade dress may also be actionable. To establish infringement with regard to a registered trademark, it is necessary only to establish that the infringing mark is identical or deceptively similar to the registered mark and no further proof is required.
Trademark infringement is an infringement of exclusive rights attaching to a trademark without the authorization of the trademark owner or nay license. Trademark infringement typically occurs when a person uses a trademark which may be either a symbol or a design, with the resembles to the products owned by the other party. The trademark owner may begin an officially permitted proceeding against a party, which infringes its registration. There are two types of remedies are available to the owner of a trademark for unauthorized use of its imitation by a third party. These remedies are an action for passing off in the case of an unregistered trademark and an action for infringement case of a registered trademark. An infringement action and an action for passing off are quite different from each other, an infringement action is a statutory remedy and an action for passing off is a common law remedy.
In case of infringement/passing off trademark, a criminal complaint can also be filed. It may be noted that under the Provisions f the Trade Marks Act, 1999, the offences under the Act are Cognizable, meaning there by the police can register an FIR (First Information Report) and prosecute the offenders directly.

                  What is Trademark?
                </h3>
                <p>
                  A trademark is a projection of a name, word, label, device or numeric characters utilized by a business to differentiate its goods and services from other similar goods and services. A trademark works as an exclusive identity of the goods and/ or services that a person is offering/ selling from other such goods/ services.
                  A trademark once registered is an intangible asset or intellectual property for a business which is used to safeguard the company's investment in the brand or symbol. <br>
                  Besides this, trademarks that are deceptive, generic, offensive, similar, contains exclusively protected emblems, etc. cannot be registered either.

                  How to File a Trademark Objection Reply in India?
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Filing a Trademark objection reply is compulsory otherwise one shall lose the brand protection or it may be abandoned.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      <b> Need to know the Objection Ground Carefully: </b>
                      The primary step is to understand or to analyze the examination report and to determine the reason for the objection raised properly because sometimes we make mistake in understanding the objection concept which may lead to wrong filing of trademark objection reply.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      <b> Prepare or draft a Reply: </b>
                      The second step is to finalize the draft reply with the accused party. Drafting the trademark reply requires the special skill and hence should be given to the respective expert like lawyers, attorneys etc. Recent case-laws. This must be done within 1 month from the date of receipt of the notice of objection, failure to file an objection within 1 month might change the status of the Trademark to Abandoned.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Sometimes Reply is done not just by drafting but by the way of <b> TM-M </b> which includes government fees due to deletion of a word or adding a word or when goods or services written in the specific class is incorrect.
                    </p>

                      <b> Timelines for reply: </b>
                      The response has to filed within 30 days of the examination report with supporting documents. Otherwise it will be considered to be abandoned.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>

                      If the response is accepted, the application will be processed further for registration and advertisement in the Trademark Journal.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      <b> If it is not accepted: </b>
                      If the response is not accepted, the registry will mark the matter for hearing and date / time will be notified to the Trademark Agent.

The best way is to file or draft a reply against it and that to in the said time-period (30 days) so that one trademark will be safe as to avoid any unnecessary delay and to protect the said trademark from getting abandoned. If the reply to the examination report is to be filed through a different trademark agent, a fresh Power of Attorney is also required. Once the filing is done then need to draft objection / reply for the same.

                              It is one of the initial stages of the trademark registration process where the status in the Trade Mark Registry website is shown as Formalities Check Fail. This could happen in instances such as non-filing of POA, non-filing of translation/transliteration when the trademark is not in English/Hindi, filing in wrong class, etc. The reason for the Formalities objection should be ascertained and appropriate action should be taken for the application to move forward for registration.

                              The status shows as "Marked for Exam" when the trademark application has been assigned to an Examiner. The trademark would be examined as to its registrability under the various Sections of the Trade Marks Act. An examination report is then issued either accepting the trademark for publication or raising objections as to its registrability. At this stage, the applicant needs to wait for the examination report to be issued.
