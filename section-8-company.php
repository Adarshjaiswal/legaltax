                  About Section 8 Company
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Registering your NGO as a section 8 company has many perks compared to registering as a trust or a society. A Section 8 Company is a specific form of Company which is incorporated for the promotion of commerce, art, science, education, research, sports, charity, social welfare, religion, protection of environment or any such other object. It intends to apply all its profits, income, or other earnings, in promoting these objects. Pays no dividend or income to its members. These are limited companies, which are registered under the Companies Act, and will be treated as limited companies without the phrase “limited” being added to their name. They may have been registered either as “private limited or public limited companies”.
                  Section 25 Company (under Companies Act, 1956) is a prior version. Section 8 Companies are a legal form of “Non-Profit Organizations (NPOs) or Non-Governmental organizations (NGOs)”. A Section 8 Company has the authority to work anywhere in the country.

                  What is the process for registering Section 8 Company?
                </h2>
                <p>
                  The process and requirements of a Section 8 Company are exactly the same as laid down for a limited company, including all the rights and obligations that come with such a limited company. The only aspect where they differ is that a Section 8 Company cannot use the words “Section 8” or “Limited” in it’s name.

                    <p>
                      The process of registering a Section 8 Company is the same as of incorporating an NGO, Trust or Co-operative Society under the Companies Act 2013.
                    </p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <p>
                      An additional requirement is there of seeking a license from the central government under Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013.

                  <li>
                    <p>
                      The license, essentially, permits them to delete Private/Public Limited from their name. With this license, the company becomes eligible for certain exemptions from the provisions of law and avail the benefit of concessions in the fee.
                    </p>

                  <li>
                    <p>
                      If the proposed Section 8 Company has been registered as a private limited then a minimum of 2 directors are required. But if it is a “public limited Section 8 Company” then a minimum of 3 directors must be there.
