                  Legal Notice for Wife to Come Back Home
                </p>
                <p>
                  If the wife left the company of husband/matrimonial house, without any reasonable excuse,, he may
                  approach the court for (RCR)restitution of conjugal rights.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The husband can send a legal notice to the wife to come back. But before taking any kind of legal
                  action in India against his wife, it’s and ideallyt step for the husband to send a well-drafted (that
                  should not contain any hard language) legal notice to her and give her an opportunity to come back
                  home.

                </p>

                <p>
                  The decree of restitution of conjugal rights cannot be executed by forcing the party . The decree can
                  be executed on the basis of attachments in relation. This practice has shown that the decree of
                  restitution is a paper decree.
                </p>

                <p>
                  However, if the decree of restitution of conjugal rights is not honored for a period of more than one
                  year subsequent to the date of the decree, it becomes a ground for divorce, and the husband can
                  then directly send divorce notice to wife, under the guidance of divorce lawyer.

                <p>
                  If your divorce was commenced on or after January 25, 2016, this Notice is
                  required to be given to you by the Supreme Court of the county where your
                  divorce was filed to comply with the Maintenance Guidelines Law ([S.
                  5678/A. 7645], Chapter 269, Laws of 2015) because you may not have
                  counsel in this action to advise you. It does not mean that your spouse (the
                  person you are married to) is seeking or offering an award of “Maintenance”
                  in this action. “Maintenance” means the amount to be paid to the other
                  spouse for support after the divorce is final.

                </p>
                <p>
                  You are hereby given notice that under the Maintenance Guidelines Law
                  (Chapter 269, Laws of 2015), there is an obligation to award the guideline
                  amount of maintenance on income up to $203,000 to be paid by the party
                  with the higher income (the maintenance payor) to the party with the lower
                  income (the maintenance payee) according to a formula, unless the parties
                  agree otherwise or waive this right. Depending on the incomes of the parties,
                  the obligation might fall on either the Plaintiff or Defendant in the action.

                </p>
                <p>
                  There are two formulas to determine the amount of the obligation. If you and
                  your spouse have no children, the higher formula will apply. If there are
                  children of the marriage, the lower formula will apply, but only if the
                  maintenance payor is paying child support to the other spouse who has the
                  children as the custodial parent. Otherwise the higher formula will apply.

                </p>
                <p>
                  Lower Formula 1-Multiply Maintenance Payor’s Income by 20% . 2- Multiply
                  Maintenance Payee’s Income by 25% . Subtract Line 2 from Line 1: = Result 1
                  Subtract Maintenance Payee’s Income from 40 % of Combined Income* =
                  Result 2. Enter the lower of Result 2 or Result 1, but if less than or equal to
                  zero, enter zero. THIS IS THE CALCULATED GUIDELINE AMOUNT OF
                  MAINTENANCE WITH THE LOWER FORMULA
                  Higher Formula 1-Multiply Maintenance Payor’s Income by 30% 2- Multiply
                  Maintenance Payee’s Income by 20% Subtract Line 2 from Line 1= Result 1
                  Subtract Maintenance Payee’s Income from 40 % of Combined Income*=
                  Result 2 Enter the lower of Result 2 or Result 1, but if less than or equal to
                  zero, enter zero
                  THIS IS THE CALCULATED GUIDELINE AMOUNT OF MAINTENANCE WITH
                  THE HIGHER FORMULA
                  *Combined Income equals Maintenance Payor’s Income up to $203,000 plus
                  Maintenance Payee’s Income.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <b>Note: </b> The Court will determine how long maintenance will be paid in
                  accordance with the statute. (Rev. 3/1/22)
