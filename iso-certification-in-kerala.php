               <h3>Is ISO certification mandatory in Kerala?</h3>
               <p>f we talk about ISO certification in Kerala, although it is not mandatory, if you want to take your business forward, then you need it. So it is not mandatory as per the Kerala law because it is a process through which you can improve your business, provide security, increase its value, and many more things after getting ISO certified. There are benefits, but it is not mandatory, so if you want, you can do it; if you don't feel you need it, then don't do it. But keep in mind that if you ever need to join any partnership or any business, then you may need ISO certification, and without this, you will not be able to take your company forward. This will provide information to your client, and he will be able to read your business well, due to which the client will also be able to trust you. So we have told you this information, whether it is mandatory or not. If you feel it is important for you, then do ISO certification, and if you do not feel it is important for you, then do not do it. But if we are asked, we will say that it is necessary for any type of company because, with it, you can continuously improve and increase growth.</p>
