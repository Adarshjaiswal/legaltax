                <h2>ISO Certification in India </h2>
              
                <p>The International Standard ISO 9001 Certification provides the standards for a Quality Management System (QMS). Organizations use the standard to demonstrate their ability to consistently supply products and services that meet consumer and regulatory standards. It is the most widely used standard in the ISO 9000 series and the only one to which organizations may certify.</p>
                <p>The International Organization for Standardization (ISO), an international organization formed of national standards organizations from over 160 countries, first released ISO 9001 in 1987. The most recent ISO 9001 version was issued in September 2015.</p>
                <p>ISO 9001:2015 applies to all organizations, regardless of size or industry. The ISO certification 9001 standard criteria have been used to improve the quality management systems of over a million organizations in over 160 countries.</p>
                <p>Organizations of all sizes find that implementing the ISO 9001 standard enables them to: organise operations, increase process efficiency, continuously improve, and achieve customer satisfaction.</p>
                <p>ISO 9001 certification is not a requirement, but it can help organizations demonstrate to customers, suppliers, regulators, and other stakeholders that they have implemented an effective QMS. To become certified, an organization must implement a QMS that meets the requirements of ISO certification 9001 and undergo an audit by an accredited certification body. The ISO Certification in India is valid for three years and must be renewed periodically.</p>
