                  Copyright is a legal right that is given to the creator or author of the original work by
                  the law of the country so that the author can protect his interest in the work while
                  using or trading in it. A copyright refers to a creator’s rightful proprietorship of their
                  work. Register your copyright for legal recognition. During the registration process,
                  the applicant is notifies if there are any objections to the claim of ownership or if there
                  are any discrepancies in the application on the grounds of similarity of work or
                  duplication of work with the other works, then the Registrar can raise an objection and
                  ask for the clarification for the same from the applicant. The applicant is required to
                  file a reply to the copyright objection within 30 days from the issuance of the
                  discrepancy letter by the registrar. Hence, the article will provide you with the
                  information regarding how to file a reply to copyright objections in India.

                  Why Copyright Registration is Important?
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Copyright is a legal right provided to the creator or author of the original work for its
                  use and trade. Any work that comes under the categories such as literary, music,
                  dramatic, artistic, sound recording, cinematograph films, architectural, computer
                  program/ software which is new and unique and is not similar or duplicate to already
                  existing works is considered to be an original work and can be registered under the
                  <i>Copyright Act, 1957.</i> <br><br>
                  The copyright registration is important so as to provide legal rights and claims to the
                  owner of the original work and to provide protection to their work. Copyright
                  registration allows placing the original work on record under the copyright laws. Any
                  person who is the author or creator of the original work can file for the copyright
                  registration in India.

                      The first step to
                      reply to copyright objection is to analyse the copyright objection that is raised by the
                      registrar and understand why the application is objected and under which relevant
                      section of the act it is done.

                      <b>Step 2: Draft a Reply: </b>
                      The applicant must then draft a reply to the copyright
                      objection. This should be done very carefully and must include the relevant judgments
                      and rule of law supporting the case and the reasons why it should get copyrighted.

                      Once the applicant has drafted a valid reply, he must file reply
                      to the copyright objection along with all the necessary documents with the registrar of
                      copyright within the 30 days of the issuance of the discrepancy letter.

                      If the registrar of copyright finds the reply to
                      copyright objection valid, he shall remove or set aside the copyright objection and
                      shall proceed further with the copyright registration and issue a Certificate of

                <p>
                  Copyright Objection is an objection raised by the Registrar of Copyright when the
                  author’s work in the copyright application is similar to the work which already exists
                  in the market. Hence, the applicant is given an opportunity to file a reply and state his
                  reasons against the Copyright objection. The applicant’s reply must be strong so as to
                  make him competent for the Copyright registration and avail legal protection for his
                  creation.

                  notice. A copyright refers to a creator’s rightful proprietorship of their work. Register
                  your copyright for legal recognition. During the registration process, the applicant is
                  notified if there are any objections to the claim of ownership or if there are any
                  discrepancies in the application. The applicant must reply to that notice by responding

                  Objections and Discrepancies in a Copyright Application
                </h3>

                <p>
                  A copyright objection arises when a third-party files an application claiming that the
                  copyright in question reflects a pre-existing expression of an idea already belonging to
                  them. The party seeking a response to a copyright objection in order to justify the
                  issues raised receives the results in letters. In certain cases, the Registrar might also
                  call for a hearing where the registration can either be accepted or rejected.

                </p>

                <p>
                  When the copyright office uncovers grounds to place a query on the application, do so
                  in the form of letters to the applicant. In exchange they expect an explanation during
                  the course of the examination; this is referred to as a copyright discrepancy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  An objection may be raised for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, a
                  lack of distinctiveness or the discovery of any incorrect details in the copyright
                  application. The applicant then needs to reply to the discrepancy letter by justifying
                  the issues raised. The approval or rejection of the application depends on this reply.

                </h3>

                <p>
                  After a thorough examination, the Registrar conveys to the applicant the existence of
                  objection(s), if any, and requests for documents to counter the same. It is the legal
                  obligation of the copyright application to file a response to the copyright objection
                  letter. On not receiving any response, the Registrar may cancel the copyright
                  application and mark it as ‘rejected’.
                  To avoid such rejection and obtain the legal rights to one’s work, a quick response is
                  required. Get in touch with the experts at <a href="legalta.in">Legaltax</a> for help drafting a well-worded

                <p>
                  The response to a copyright objection or discrepancy letter is a legal document. The
                  drafting of the same requires complex legal knowledge and excellent drafting skills.
                  There are two ways to file a response: either by the creator themselves, if they have
                  the necessary competencies to explain their work, or by hiring a legal team to do so.
                  We recommend seeking professional assistance. As previously stated, the response to
                  an objection/discrepancy notice is a legal document and the very ownership of one’s
                  work is at stake. <br><br>
                  Although there is no standard format to draft a response to a copyright objection letter,
                  there are certain pointers to keep in mind while drafting it. Hence we suggest you keep

                  Based on whether or not the registrar is satisfied with the contents of the response
                  letter, a hearing might be arranged. <br>
                  Hence it naturally follows that such a reply calls for utmost professionalism to ensure
                  a good outcome at the end of the copyright registration process. It may, however,
                  depend on the language of the letter. Responding to a copyright objection is merely a
                  procedure that does not ensure the registration of one’s copyright. Furthermore, after
                  filing the reply, the creator must follow up with the relevant registrar’s office. This is
                  to ensure that the process is completed as quickly as possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Moreover, if an objection is filed, it takes an additional month to determine whether
                  the copyright can be registered or not. Further to that, because obtaining copyright is
                  crucial as legal proof of ownership, one must exercise extreme caution in order to
                  ensure the copyright application’s success. Hence do not hesitate to seek professional
                  legal counsel to help with the entire process.

                  What Are the Benefits of Filing Reply to Copyright Objection in India?
                </h3>
                <p>
                  A reply to copyright objection is submitted to the registrar of the copyright requesting
                  for the clarifications in terms of the objections raised. It is necessary to file a reply to
                  copyright objections in India. Few of the benefits of filing a reply are as follows:
                </p>



                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      It is important to reply to copyright objections quickly so as to gain and retain
                      the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_rights_and_legal_rights">legal rights</a> of the work.

                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      When an objection is raised by the registrar in respect to the application, the
                      applicant is required to file a reply for the same. If the reply is not submitted in
                      any event, then the registrar of copyright has the right to revoke the copyright
                      application and list the application as rejected on the copyright bulletin.
                      Therefore, it is necessary for the applicant to avoid such circumstances; he
                      must file a reply to the copyright objection on time.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      While giving a reply to copyright objection, there is no standard format for
                      drafting a reply to the letter of copyright objection. The application can be
                      drafted in two forms that is, either the application can be drafted by the
                      applicant personally if he has the sufficient legal knowledge to explain the
                      work which he has done or he can take the assistance of the legal specialist to
                      help him to draft a reply to copyright objection.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What Happens if the Reply to Copyright Objection is Not Filed? </h3>
                <p>
                  In cases where the reply to copyright objection is not filed within the specified period
                  of time, the registrar has a right to cancel the application for copyright and the status
                  of application shall be updated as <i><b>“Rejected”</b></i>. Therefore, to avoid such circumstances
                  or actions by the registrar, it is mandatory to file a reply to copyright objection.
                </p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                  The copyright law allows the creator or author of the original work to register its work
                  in accordance with the rules and procedure under the Copyright Act, 1957, in order to
                  protect its work from being used or infringed by others without his/ her permission.
                  However, when an application for copyright registration is submitted to the registrar
                  of copyright, an objection may be raised by him on the grounds of similarity or
                  duplication of work or similarities in application submitted by applicant to the
                  registrar. Therefore, it is important to file a reply to a copyright objection with the
                  registrar within 30 days of the objection so raised, so as to provide the clarification on
                  the objections and issue copyright registration for the original work of the author.

                              Copyright is a legal right that is given to the creator or author of the original work by

                              using or trading in it. A copyright refers to a creator’s rightful proprietorship of their
                              work. Register your copyright for legal recognition. During the registration process,
                              the applicant is notifies if there are any objections to the claim of ownership or if there

                              duplication of work with the other works, then the Registrar can raise an objection and
                              ask for the clarification for the same from the applicant. The applicant is required to
                              file a reply to the copyright objection within 30 days from the issuance of the

                              Copyright is a legal right provided to the creator or author of the original work for its
                              use and trade. Any work that comes under the categories such as literary, music,
                              dramatic, artistic, sound recording, cinematograph films, architectural, computer
                              program/ software which is new and unique and is not similar or duplicate to already
                              existing works is considered to be an original work and can be registered under the

                              The copyright registration is important so as to provide legal rights and claims to the

                              registration allows placing the original work on record under the copyright laws. Any

                              A copyright objection arises when a third-party files an application claiming that the
                              copyright in question reflects a pre-existing expression of an idea already belonging to
                              them. The party seeking a response to a copyright objection in order to justify the
                              issues raised receives the results in letters. In certain cases, the Registrar might also
                              call for a hearing where the registration can either be accepted or rejected. <br><br>
                              When the copyright office uncovers grounds to place a query on the application, do so
                              in the form of letters to the applicant. In exchange they expect an explanation during
                              the course of the examination; this is referred to as a copyright discrepancy.<br><br>
                              An objection may be raised for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, a
                              lack of distinctiveness or the discovery of any incorrect details in the copyright
                              application. The applicant then needs to reply to the discrepancy letter by justifying
                              the issues raised. The approval or rejection of the application depends on this reply.

                              After a thorough examination, the Registrar conveys to the applicant the existence of
                              objection(s), if any, and requests for documents to counter the same. It is the legal
                              obligation of the copyright application to file a response to the copyright objection
                              letter. On not receiving any response, the Registrar may cancel the copyright

                              The response to a copyright objection or discrepancy letter is a legal document. The
                              drafting of the same requires complex legal knowledge and excellent drafting skills.
                              There are two ways to file a response: either by the creator themselves, if they have
                              the necessary competencies to explain their work, or by hiring a legal team to do so.
                              We recommend seeking professional assistance. As previously stated, the response to
                              an objection/discrepancy notice is a legal document and the very ownership of one’s
                              work is at stake. <br><br>
                              Although there is no standard format to draft a response to a copyright objection letter,
                              there are certain pointers to keep in mind while drafting it. Hence we suggest you keep
                              the following in mind:

                              <p>

                                </li>

                                <li>

                                  </p>
                                </li>





                              </ul>

                              <p>
                                Based on whether or not the registrar is satisfied with the contents of the response
                                letter, a hearing might be arranged. <br><br>
                                Hence it naturally follows that such a reply calls for utmost professionalism to ensure
                                a good outcome at the end of the copyright registration process. It may, however,
                                depend on the language of the letter. Responding to a copyright objection is merely a
                                procedure that does not ensure the registration of one’s copyright. Furthermore, after
                                filing the reply, the creator must follow up with the relevant registrar’s office. This is
                                to ensure that the process is completed as quickly as possible.<br><br>
                                Moreover, if an objection is filed, it takes an additional month to determine whether
                                the copyright can be registered or not. Further to that, because obtaining copyright is
                                crucial as legal proof of ownership, one must exercise extreme caution in order to
                                ensure the copyright application’s success. Hence do not hesitate to seek professional
                                legal counsel to help with the entire process.
